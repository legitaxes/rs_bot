# Old School Runescape Bot
a personal bot that is able to cover a few simple activities in the point and click game that using a simple tool called UIPath

## It covers basic botting such as: 
```
1. High Alching
2. Fletching logs to unstrung longbow
3. Auto Prayer Flick Rapid Heal (For NMZ, to constant stay at 1HP)
4. Auto mining Iron Ore (Mining Guild near the bank)
```

## Some warnings before running the programm
- It was my first attempt at using UIPath for a game that I really liked playing
- **The Runelite client screen aspect ratio is very specific for this**. If the client screen aspect ratio is off by a little bit, the bot will not work properly!
- It is currently only optimized for my OWN personal use only
